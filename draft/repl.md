# What is repl

This came up as part of understanding the ruby toolchain.
I didn't realise previously what this actually entailed.
I now know that repl stands for read, evaluate, print, loop.
The default in ruby is irb for interactive ruby but the third party pry seems to have much nicer capabilities.

That's pretty much the end of this note but thought it was mildly interesting at the time.
The default for rails is also irb but pry-rails can configure it to use pry instead of irb.

## follow up
Debugging in ruby
- the default is like debugger or something
- but byebug with pry could also be another option which gives slightly more advanced options. (especially if you get it interacting with pry)
