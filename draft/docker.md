## Background
- What was in place before docker and deploying VMs.
- Needing to keep all the VMs up to date with like scripts
- All the operating system dependencies


- Why is docker required
   - changing the abstraction levels where this is an abstraction on the OS whereas VM was an abstraction on the hardware or something like that?
- What is the problem it solves.
- Using docker compose for getting set up quickly locally.

- What is a docker image

- Dependency on Linux which I thought was interesting
   - need to go into this in more detail.

- What are linux containers.
- 

- Reference to NixOs and that other thing that Alex Mackenzie referenced.
