# SSH you never know who's listening

So this is just a run down on how ssh works which really can be very high level as the lower level cryto stuff can be taken care of when chatting about crypto101.

As part of this just chat about ssh agent and ssh add how that all works.

For setting up SSH login for my github I can just update the ssh config so that for the domain github.com it points towards a particular key.

There are more advanced benefits of using and agent although it is mostly for using password protected keys I think.
