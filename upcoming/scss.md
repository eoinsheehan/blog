# SCSS

A preprocessing language for css and therefore styling on the browser. It is not understood by the browser and so it needs to be compiled into CSS.

I've been using Vite as my front end build tool of choice which I've found easy to get started with and understand. Vite allows you to write with scss which has some
additonal features such as 
-- name some features but I think like maps and stuff may just be scss features.

To begin with I did have some minor confusion with other devs referring to scss as sass and so I couldnt tell the difference but after I took the time to just read the landing page of the sass website it was clear thwy ate one and the same just sass uses yaml lile syntax whereas the scss implementation uses curly braces like css.

Ive used it for customising bootstrap.

Need to check if it is used in the likes of shadcn or tailwind (probably not)
