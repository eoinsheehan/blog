ok so with this I want to cover a few things

## vite
- what is the purpose of vite
- what are some of the config options for the tool
- why is the build required
- what are es modules
- how it interacts with es modules
- what is rollup and how does it rely on this also
- additional build tools that it gives you such as HMR
- how it preprocesses scss into css

### but before all this...
- what are some of the main components of a modern build tool
- what is tree shaking 
- what is minification
- what is the source map and what is its purpose.
- what is Babel (I think it's a transpiler which converts jsx into usable javascript but it could also have something to do with polyfill for better compatibility with older browser versions.
- Static assets - mention that as a general rule web servers make the public folder accessible
